# Credo configuration for Money.Input.
#
# Mirrors the Localize policy: strict, with `Design.AliasUsage` disabled.
# Component and validator code fully qualifies many calls because module
# names such as `Money.Input.ValidationError` and `Localize.Number` read
# more clearly at the call site than an alias, and because trailing
# segments such as `Input`, `Format` and `List` shadow other modules when
# aliased. Alias submodules opportunistically where the trailing segment
# does not clash, never as a bulk conversion.
